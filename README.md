## About the Case Study

This project analyzes health insurance costs to uncover how demographics and lifestyle choices drive premiums. All elements of the case study are imaginary though the dataset _may be_ real. You'll learn to:  
- Build and interpret linear regression models.  
- Diagnose model performance using visualizations.  
- Apply insights to real-world problems.
